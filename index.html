      <h2>Our Love Story</h2>
      <p>
        I was just a lil boy healing from my emotions, but then i saw my
        princess charming in a gc when she cursed at a friend of mine, i knew
        she was the one and as i was looking for the love of my life i chose her
        but then i had many obstacles as she liked another boy which she called
        her man and at the moment that broke my heart but i wouldn't give up my
        delusions on making her my queen. So i kept trying and trying and trying
        eventually she grew a lil fond of me then said she loved me 40% and that
        boy 60%. Now that messed me up real bad for real but a man doesn't give
        up so i still wanted her then, i got lucky after she found out that boy
        was from another religion ans she gave up on him then she was crying and
        that was when i came like her prince charming and saved her from sorrow.
        I asked her to be mine, she was hesitant but i was serious and told her
        to make a decision then she chose me and that's how our love story
        began. At first we were very different people but after a lot of
        arguments and errors and trials we started molding into each other's
        perfect partner and we still love each other more day by day
